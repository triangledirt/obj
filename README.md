## [obj_t](OBJ.md)

obj defines an obj_t as a binary object--an object with binary attributes

then it lets you do things with binary objects--right now it lets you classify them--soon it may be able to synchronize and model them

## [classify](CLASS.md)

classify lets you classify binary objects

first you supply a series of objects (each with binary attributes and a binary classification)--you know the classes of these objects and you supply them to classify when you observe them

then (with new objects whose classes you do not know) you ask case to classify the objects--which it does with a 0 or a 1 (a bit to let you know whether case thinks the object is a member of the target set)
